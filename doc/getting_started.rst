Makefiles
~~~~~~~~~

The main Makefile for the project is in the
``app_simple_avb_demo`` directory. This file specifies build
options and used modules.

Running the application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To upgrade the firmware you must, firstly connect the XTAG-2 to the 
relevant development board and plug the XTAG-2 into your PC or Mac.

Using the XMOS xTIMEcomposer Studio
-----------------------------------

Using the 12.0.0 tools or later and AVB version 5.2.0 or
later, from within the xTIMEcomposer Studio:

 #. Right click on the binary within the bin folder of the project.
 #. Choose `Run As` |submenu| `Run Configurations`
 #. Double click `xCORE Application` in the left panel
 #. Choose `hardware` in `Device options` and select the relevant XTAG-2 adapter
 #. Select the `Run XScope output server` check box.
 #. Click on **Apply** if configuration has changed
 #. Click on **Run**

Using the Command Line Tools
----------------------------

#. Open the XMOS command line tools (Command Prompt) and
   execute the following command:


   ::

       xrun --xscope <binary>.xe

#. If multiple XTAG2s are connected, obtain the adapter ID integer by executing:

   :: 

      xrun -l

#. Execute the `xrun` command with the adapter ID flag

   :: 

      xrun --id <id> --xscope <binary>.xe



Installing the application onto flash
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Connect the XTAG-2 debug adapter to the relevant development
   board, then plug the XTAG-2 into your PC or Mac.


Using the XMOS xTIMEcomposer Studio
-----------------------------------

To upgrade the flash from the xTIMEcomposer Studio, follow these steps:


#. Start the xTIMEcomposer Studio and open the workspace created in **Running the application**.
#. Right click on the binary within the bin folder of the project.
#. Choose `Flash As` |submenu| `Flash Configurations`
#. Double click `xCORE Application` in the left panel
#. Choose `hardware` in `Device options` and select the relevant XTAG-2 adapter
#. Click on **Apply** if configuration has changed
#. Click on **Flash**

Using Command Line Tools
------------------------


#. Open the XMOS command line tools (Command Prompt) and
   execute the following command:

   ::

       xflash <binary>.xe

#. If multiple XTAG2s are connected, obtain the adapter ID integer by executing:

   :: 

      xrun -l

#. Execute the `xflash` command with the adapter ID flag

   :: 

      xflash --id <id> <binary>.xe

Audio Components

AVB Streams, Channels, Talkers and Listeners
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Audio is transported in streams of data, where each stream may have multiple
channels. Endpoints producing streams are called *Talkers* and
those receiving them are called *Listeners*. Each stream on the
network has a unique 64-bit stream ID. 

.. index:: sink, source

A single endpoint can be a Talker, a Listener or both. In general each
endpoint will have a number of *sinks* with the capacity to receive
a number of incoming streams and a number of *sources* with the
capacity to transmit a number of streams.

Routing is done using layer 2 Ethernet addresses. Each stream is sent from a particular source MAC address to a particular
destination MAC address. The destination MAC address is a
multicast address so that several Listeners may receive it. In addition,
AVB switches can reserve an end-to-end path with guaranteed bandwidth
for a stream. This is done by the Talker endpoint advertising the
stream to the switches and the Listener(s) registering to receive it. If
sufficient bandwidth is not available, this registration will fail.

Streams carry their own *presentation time*, the time
that samples are due to be output, allowing multiple Listeners that
receive the same stream to output in sync.

 * Streams are encoded using the 1722 AVB transport protocol.
 * All channels in a stream must be synchronized to
   the same sample clock.
 * All the channels in a stream must come from the same Talker.
 * Routing of audio streams uses Ethernet layer 2 routing based on a multicast destination MAC address
 * Routing of channels is done at the stream level. All channels within a
   stream must be routed to the same place. However, a stream can be
   multicast to several Listeners, each of which picks out different
   channels.
 * A single end point can be both a Talker and Listener.
 * Information such as stream ID and destination MAC address of a Talker stream should be communicated to Listeners via 1722.1.

Internal Routing, Media FIFOs

As described in the previous section, an IEEE 1722 audio stream may
consist of many channels. These channels need to be routed to
particular audio I/Os on the endpoint. To achieve maximum flexibility
the XMOS design uses intermediate media FIFOs to route
audio.  Each FIFO contains a single channel of audio.

The above figure shows the breakdown of 1722 streams
into local FIFOs. The figure shows four points where
transitions to and from media FIFOs occur. For audio being received by
an endpoint:

  #. When a 1722 stream is received, its channels are mapped to output
     media FIFOs. This mapping can be configured
     dynamically so that it can be changed at runtime by the configuration component.
  #. The digital hardware interface maps media FIFOs to audio
     outputs. This mapping is fixed and is configured statically in the
     software. 

For audio being transmitted by an endpoint:

  #. The digital hardware interface maps digital audio inputs to
     local media FIFOs. This mapping is fixed and cannot be changed
     at runtime.

  #. Several input FIFOs can be combined into a 1722 stream. This
     mapping is dynamic.

The configuration of the mappings is handled through the API describe
in :ref:`sec_avb_api`.

.. note::
  
   Media FIFOs uses shared memory to move data between tasks, thus the
   filling and emptying of the FIFO must be on the same tile.


Talker Units

A talker unit consists of one logcial core which creates *IEEE 1722* packets and passes the audio samples onto the MAC. Audio
samples are passed to this component via input media FIFOs.
Samples are pushed into this FIFO from a different task implementing the audio hardware interface. The packetizer task removes the samples and combines them into *IEEE 1722* Ethernet packets to be transmitted via the MAC component. 

When the packets are created the timestamps are converted to the time domain of the global clock provided by the PTP component, and a fixed offset is added to the timestamps to provide the *presentation time* of the samples (*i.e* the time at which the sample should be played by a Listener). 

A system may have several Talker units. However, since samples are
passed via a shared memory interface a talker can only combine input FIFOs
that are created on the same tile as the talker. The instantiating of 
talker units is performed via the API described in Section
:ref:`sec_component_api`. Once the talker unit starts, it registers
with the main control task and is control via the main AVB API
described in Section :ref:`sec_avb_api`.

Listener Units

A Listener unit takes *IEEE 1722* packets from the MAC
and converts them into a sample stream to be fed into a media FIFOs.
Each audio Listener component can listen to several *IEEE 1722*
streams.

A system may have several Listener units. The instantiating of 
Listener units is performed via the API described in Section
:ref:`sec_component_api`. Once the Listener unit starts, it registers
with the main control task and is controlled via the main AVB API
described in Section :ref:`sec_avb_api`.

Media FIFOs to XC Channels
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Sometimes it is useful to convert the audio stream in a media FIFO
into a sample stream over an XC channel. This may be needed to move
samples off tile or if the audio interface task requires samples
over a channel. Several functions are provided to do this and are
described in Section :ref:`sec_component_api`.

Audio Hardware Interfaces
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

The audio hardware interface components drive external audio hardware, pull
audio out of media output FIFOs and push into media input FIFOs. 

Different interfaces interact in different ways, some
directly push and pull from the media FIFOs, whereas some for
performance reasons require samples to be provided of an XC
channel.

The following diagram shows one potential layout of the I2S component
which pushes its input directly to media input FIFOs but takes output
FIFOs from an XC channel. The diagram shows the supporting task that
takes samples out of the media output FIFOs and serializes them over
an XC channel:

A simple 1722.1 example endpoint application

Tested configurations for 16ch in / 16ch out with TDM
=====================================================
Note: See Makefile for details on the naming convention.

Between two XMOS EPs
--------------------
Test Setup:
***********
   * Two XMOS Single-port EPs connected via a switch.
   * The Mac running UNOS is also connected to the Switch. UNOS is used to connect streams.

Results: 
********
3 out of 4 16-channel configs are working between two XMOS EPs:
   * 1t1s16ch_1l1s16ch_TDM
   * 1t2s16ch_1l2s16ch_TDM
   * 1t4s16ch_1l4s16ch_TDM

On the Mac:
-----------
Test Setup:
***********
   * Single XMOS EP connected to a Mac running Maverics
   * For TDM loopback: Using Jumper Wires, connect SDATA_OUT0 to SDATA_IN0 and SDATA_OUT1 to SDATA_IN1
   * Use Audacity to send audio to the EP (limit is two) and receive 16 channels from the EP
   * Press the channel select button on the EP to cycle the 2 output channels through the 16 input channels.

Result:
*******
   * Only 1 out of 4 is working on the Mac: 1t1s16ch_1l1s16ch_TDM

Known limitations:
==================
   * On the MAC: Limit is currently 4 streams. That means the 1t8s16ch_1l8s16ch_TDM configuration can not be tested
   * 1t2s16ch_1l2s16ch_TDM only works when 5 cores are running

Known issues:
=============
   * 1t1s16ch_1l1s16ch_TDM only works when the min delay of sending a Talker packet is reduced slightly. See Bug 14812
   * Between two XMOS EPs: 1t8s16ch_1l8s16ch_TDM looses lock when the 8th stream is connected. See Bug 14811
   * On the MAC: Any config wtih > 1 Stream per EP doesnâ€™t work because of a 1722.1 descriptor issue. See Bug 14679
   * When looping back the stereo channel over audacity on the MAC, the received stereo channel index is not continuous. See Bug 14813
